        <ul>
            <li>Lab #3</li>
            <p> I thought the sandwhich mad lib was really interesting early on. This being the first coding that made me think about the logics we were learning. It was the first 
                coding I had done where we tested it in order to find the errors we were making. Overall it was a very good jumping off point for me early on.

            <li>Lab #5</li>
            <p> Although I thought the blackjack was iteresting, the sandwhich condiment code was more rewarding to me. It taught me in depth how inputs and outputs function. It 
                also used similiar ideas to the previous labs and showed me how a person can build on their code to start making more complex programs.

            <li>Lab #3</li>
            <p> This is why I think this lab was cool.</p>
